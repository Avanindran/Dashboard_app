# ðŸ“ˆ ML Insurance Charges Prediction Dashboard
A comprehensive Streamlit dashboard designed to analyse insurance charge data, visualise key feature relationships, and evaluate various Machine Learning models for predicting individual medical costs.

# Dependencies required
Standard Python libraries for data analysis and visualisation (refer to the requirements.txt file)

# Homepage
**Interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** focusing on the relationships between demographic features and insurance charges.
Visualisations of features vs. charges (e.g., scatter plots, box plots).

# Pairplot
Displays **pairplots** of all relevant features to visually analyse relationships and check for **collinearity** between independent variables.

# ML Model Evaluation
Presents **accuracy metrics** (e.g., $R^2, MSE, MAE) for all trained Machine Learning models.

# K-fold Cross-Validation
Performs and visualizes **K-fold Cross-Validation** results to ensure model robustness.
**Scree Plot** analysis and an **interactive slider** to observe how error metrics change with a change in the value of **K**
